vim-stay adds automated view session creation and restoration whenever editing a buffer, across Vim sessions and window life cycles. It also alleviates Vim's tendency to lose view state when cycling through buffers (via `argdo`, `bufdo` et al.). It is smart about which buffers should be persisted and which should not, making the procedure painless and invisible.

If you have wished Vim would be smarter about keeping your editing state, vim-stay is for you.
